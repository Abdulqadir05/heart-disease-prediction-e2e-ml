# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction — End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline  
**An advanced clinical risk prediction system using EDA, preprocessing pipelines, Gradient Boosting, Optuna tuning, and a deployed Streamlit App.**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project builds a complete **End-to-End Heart Disease Prediction System** using a structured machine learning workflow:

- ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ✔ Data cleaning & imputation  
- ✔ Statistical testing (Chi-square, t-test)  
- ✔ Encoding, scaling & preprocessing with `ColumnTransformer`  
- ✔ Gradient Boosting Classifier with **Optuna hyperparameter tuning**  
- ✔ Evaluation (AUC, Recall, Precision)  
- ✔ Saving deployable **final pipeline model**  
- ✔ Modern, dark-neon **Streamlit Web App** for real-time prediction  

This makes it a **production-grade ML project**, ideal for deployment and real-world demonstration.

## 📊 Dataset Summary  
The dataset contains **918 patient records** with clinical features such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting BP  
- Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG  
- Max Heart Rate  
- Exercise-Induced Angina  
- ST Depression (Oldpeak)  
- ST Slope  

Target: **HeartDisease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)**

## 🔍 Key Insights from EDA  
Some critical findings:

- **Cholesterol had 172 zero values** → treated using median imputation  
- **RestingBP contained 1 zero value**  
- **Gender imbalance** → 79% Male, 21% Female  
- **ASY chest pain** strongly correlates with disease presence  
- **Oldpeak** and **MaxHR** are among the strongest numeric predictors  
- Heatmap reveals important correlations within clinical features  

Full EDA is available inside:

## 🧠 Modeling Approach  
### 🔧 Preprocessing  
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical features  
- RobustScaler for numeric features  
- Transformation handled entirely inside a `ColumnTransformer`  
- No data leakage — transformations wrapped fully inside the pipeline  

### 🔥 Model  
- **GradientBoostingClassifier**  
- Tuned using **Optuna**  
- Cross-validated AUC optimisation  
- Final AUC: **0.94+**  
- Final Recall: **~0.91 (can be optimized via threshold tuning)**

## 🎯 Optuna Tuning  
Hyperparameters optimized:

- Number of estimators  
- Learning rate  
- Max depth  
- Subsample ratio  
- Min samples split & leaf  

Optuna’s trial history & best value are inside the notebook.

## 🤖 Saved Model  
The final deployable model pipeline:

📦 `model/heart_disease_model.pkl`  
Contains:  
- Preprocessor  
- Encoder  
- Scaler  
- Best Gradient Boosting Model  

This can be directly used in any application.
